#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Code Snippet of Insurance Dataset
It consists of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an Insurance dataset

This repository contains a Python code snippet for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset. The goal of this code is to provide a starting point for exploring and understanding a new dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used in this code snippet is [insurance.csv](https://github.com/Levi-Lamar/insurance-EDA/files/10929456/insurance.csv)
, which contains information about customers of an online store. It includes several features such as age, sex, bmi, children, lsmoker, region, and charges. The dataset has 1338 rows and 7 columns.

Code
The eda.py file contains Python code for performing EDA on the dataset. The code uses Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries.

The code starts by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and cleaning the data. Then, it performs several statistical analyses and visualizations to gain insights into the data. Some of the analyses and visualizations performed include:

Summary statistics for numerical features,
Bar plots and pie charts for categorical features
Histograms and density plots for numerical features
Scatter plots and correlation matrices for exploring relationships between features
The code is well-documented and includes comments explaining each step of the EDA process. It can be easily modified and adapted to work with other datasets.

Results
The results of the EDA are presented in the results directory. The directory contains several visualizations created by the code, such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts. The visualizations provide insights into the dataset and can be used to answer research questions about the data.

Conclusion
The EDA code in this repository provides a starting point for exploring and understanding the dataset. It can be used to gain insights into the data, answer research questions, and prepare the data for further analysis. The code can be easily modified and adapted to work with other datasets.
